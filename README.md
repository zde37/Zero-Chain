# High-Performance Blockchain Network

## Overview
This project is a high-performance blockchain network developed using Golang. The network supports multiple nodes, uses a secure Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, ECC for key generation, and SHA-256 for block hashing.

## Features
- Supports multiple nodes for enhanced scalability and performance.
- Secure PoW consensus mechanism for block validation.
- Utilizes ECC for secure key generation and SHA-256 for block hashing.
- Users can create wallets, securely generate public/private key pairs and participate in mining activities.
- The network can facilitate Y transactions per second, optimized for real-time usability.
- Seamless interaction with the blockchain network through an integrated blockchain explorer for real-time visualization of the blockchain ledger.
- GRPC and Protobuf for efficient internal service communication and secure gateway for external communication.
